#readODS


read ODS files into R

gives you a data.frame per sheet



##how it works:
ODS files are basically a zip file with all the stuff in it.
The most important file is contents.xml which contains all the numbers and formulas used in the ODS spreadsheet.
this is the only file currently looked at.

it uses the XML package to search through the contents.xml file.

### readODS
returns the sheets as a list of data.frames with each data.frame being the contents of a sheet

accepts the following parameters:
- file - filepath to the ods file
- sheet - the sheet(s) you want, if left empty it will return all sheets in a list, if only 1 number is given it will return the sheet as a data.frame (not as a list of data.frames)
- formulaAsFormula - switch to display formulas as formulas "SUM(A1:A3)" or as the resulting value "3"... or "8".. default=FALSE
